I believe that I am a good executive for several reasons. First off, I have strong organizational skills, which allows me to effectively manage the money of the executive. Secondly, I am committed to my role on the executive. I always attend meetings, help out wherever possible, and help with certain events such as bartending mixers. Finally, I believe I am friendly and get along with just about everybody. This is a valuable trait for an executive member as it allows a strong, positive, and productive environment. I really enjoyed sitting on the executive last winter, and would love to continue doing so in the Fall 2020 semester. Thank you for considering me as Treasurer for the upcoming year and I hope to be able to represent all of my peers as a member of the Executive once again! :)
","I am currently a 4th year computer science student, however I am currently working as a Full Stack Developer at TotaliQ as part of the CICS program offered by the Computer Science Department. Therefore, I will be tentatively graduating in The Winter 2021-2022 semester. I was drawn to CS for several reasons. First, I am a very problem-oriented worker, and at its core computer science is simply problem solving in logical languages. Secondly, I love the flexibility of computer science. Knowing how to program essentially empowers you to build, create, or solve any problem you may have.","dylan.jpg"

When attending post-secondary in Ontario I was the President of my College's Student Association. I'm familiar with the everyday tasks and the added workload of being a volunteer member and am willing to accept that responsibility.

What would make me a good executive; Treasurer
I have a certificate in Business Fundamentals, and have worked as an accounts payable clerk. I also have experience being a signing authority for organizations such as NCSA and 1st Crowsnest Pass Multi-Unit Branch with Girl Guides of Canada. I'm comfortable with a ledger, and responsible with group funds.

What would make me a good executive; Executive Assistant
I am comfortable taking meeting minutes and have read through Robert's Rules of order. My certificate in Business Fundamentals included courses in Business Management and Human resources. Most of my friends consider me their secretary because I aid them in keeping their meetings and appointments organized.

What would make me a good executive; Event Coordinator
I am a bartender certified with Smart Serve (Ontario Certification). I am familiar with serving laws and regulations. While bar-tending at my previous post-secondary institution I was often set to plan themed pub nights to interest students. Coordinating events was also something I was asked to do as Student Association President, from Frosh Week, to Pub Nights, to Mental Health Initiatives. 

What would make me a good executive; First Year Student Representative
I may not have a wide variety of CS experience. I believe I have a wide variety of obscure knowledge, which would make me applicable for any of the 3 choices above. However, I would just be happy to be on the board if you think there is another person more suitable for the roles I'm applying for. In that case, I'd also like to apply to be a First Year Student Representative. So I may gain more experience, and re-apply next election period. 

Thank you","This is my first semester. (I have 15 transfer credits)

The vital teaching of knowledge and aid, especially in this time of the pandemic where online discord is primary and facilities like help centres will prove complicated to implement to the best degree, is to be encouraged. Sharing platforms such as discord within the cs community will allow us to thrive in these most trying times and continue to instill the spirit of teamwork so crucial to working in the cs environment. I also plan to use my seat on the constitution to give further reach to first-year students, including international students, who may be having a hard time and help from an older undergrad shows promise and hope. ","Winter of 2020 will officially be my third year. Computer Science challenges my brain in ways I did not expect. Never before in my life would I think I would concern myself with the inner mechanization of a coin-operated dispensary machine. The processes of identifying the coin, categorizing the deposit based on the amount between various possibilities, and deciding on which best output to go with is the kind of brain puzzle that is just so disconcerning of my interests and yet so intricately fascinating that it pleases my soul to have solved it.
Computer Science is filled with so many possibilities and alternate universes which one must carefully account for in order to have a working model. We are architects of operations. Speakers of a language so archaic that we reformed it and taught our machines how to sing along to the same song. Designers of an imaginary world that sprouted in our minds.

During my time as an executive I had shared responsibility with the rest of the council. A normal week would include keeping the financial books in-check, meeting with student advisers to help resolve on-going student conflicts, checking-in with facilities to ensure the council had the required furniture for upcoming events, be on the phone with suppliers for inventory management, and help run a ""pub night"" at the end of the week to ensure the students had the opportunity to let off some steam in a safe, controlled environment. I never missed a council meeting and ensured that the minutes were well documented and available for public viewing as soon as possible. I am confident in my ability to communicate with the executive board, members of the society, MUN Faculty, and outside suppliers. I am also comfortable with bringing forth any issues or concerns to the executive board without hesitation. 

Treasurer: I am currently pursuing the BSc. Joint Major in Computer Science and Economics. I am comfortable with money management and know the importance of budget planning, regulated spending, and oversight. I have previous experience helping the Treasury Officer on the student council at Northern College. I have helped organise receipts, organise sponsorship with local companies, plan budgets for upcoming semesters, and was a signing authority for the account. I also helped draft oversight amendments to the council constitution to reduce the risk that student money would be spent inappropriately.

Representative-at-Large: During my time at Northern College I had the privilege of representing the student body. I had multiple meetings with College faculty during my time for a variety of issues. I have am confident in my ability to listen to students and understand their issues, problems, or be someone to vent to. I am also confident in my ability to bring student issues to MUN faculty in a non-confrontational way. I am also prepared to draft and present reports of student issues to the CompSci Society board in such detail that all concerns are addressed clearly and anonymity is preserved.","I have been taking computer science courses at MUN since September 2019.

Making friendships at a distance can be very important for first-year international students who may not know anybody in their classes. There should be an increase in online events to help people socialize and maybe first-year specific events also.

It would also provide me some extra experience on how to manage things,which would be very beneficial for my future. Therefore,i am more than happy to be an executive for the department. 
 
But how come I'm confident that I'll be good at it?
After getting admitted to MUN, I searched for student communities/chat groups with all my heart, to gain some guidance,make friends and to get to know my peers and the programs that are offered in much more depth. Unfortunately,I couldn't find any. So ,along with couple of my newly made friends(soon to be roomates,when the travel opens up again) I set out to groups of our own. We did! People joined! Actually,lots! lots of people joined. But that posed a huge problem, how do we manage them, answer their queries,help them with their visa problems, course, problems,social problems and oh boy,whatnot. I spent a decent amount of time during the past few months building up those communities, watching them grow and becoming a part of the family. Being an admin( in several groups that we've created on whatsapp and discord), I currently look over and manage About 3-4 bigger groups ,one with 170,the other with 80 people and then some smaller groups. Of course later on as these groups grew in size, responsibilities had to be delegated and thankfully they don't take up all of my time now.(feel free to ask me the joining links)

We also have a group on disord with over 100 people now that we consistently use for casual talks, advice and for socialising. Dayna vey(from internationalization office) personally emailed me and asked for the links.
I know it's pretty long already, but I'd be more than happy to describe the things that I did during highschool like being the president of student council,internships etc. 
So I'd say although I'm pretty confident,I sti have a lot to learn from the one's that came before me and 
A lot to give back to those that'll come after me. 
Feel free to email me.","I just started my 1st year and really looking forward to learning a lot of things, game development is what truly gauges my interest and if not for the executive, administrative positions later in my life,game dev is what I'm really looking forward to.

Hey Guys, I am Bhaskar, standing for the MUNCS elections with all my will and a desire to get elected.

Understanding problems and resolving them for people is something I love doing. Analyzing, assisting, and then implementing helps me to always come out with a solution.

Experience has ever been known to speak louder. With the experience of the head boy of my school and a CS president in the later years of high school, I feel I stand a chance in this election. I eagerly want to be of help and serve the purpose of being a good executive adhering to the social constitution.

One of the most critical skills of an executive is to deliver an optimistic attitude to its audience. Hence, none of the doubts remain unresolved. None of the creative ideas remain unrecognized, and this is something I aim to achieve.

I believe that I possess the necessary skills required to become an excellent executive. It's not something I woke up and thought to give a try at but have been under gradual and consistent practice to make myself worthy of.

My Preference and why this? (First-year Representative)

In these pandemic trying times, it becomes essential to gather the student body together and remain connected. I wish to make the whole process itself as smooth as possible.

My ability to help students with their different needs would ensure that any unresolved issues regarding the CS department are brought to society's attention. I will give special attention and be a helping hand to all the first-year CS students with my leadership qualities and organizational skills, which would help define the extents of my boundaries.

TL;DR - Lastly, I would just like to end by saying that I am an ordinary individual with just as much of desire to be a part of this representative body as the other worthy opponents but what SETS ME APART and what MAKES ME WORTHY OF such a powerful and responsible position is my zeal to perform, my enthusiasm towards the job and the confidence that I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.","Albeit I'm a first year of CS, since when I was a child, I've been fascinated with the word of computing and the infinite possibilities it carries within. I got my first computer when I was 6 years old and it then struck my nature of being curious.
I started learning the mechanics behind the plain visual screen of computer we see since a really tender age. I started learning languages from 6th standard and the first language I learnt was Java to create mobile games and later on I learnt Python as well. And then there was no turning back, I made my first computer game when I was in 9th standard. I also learnt data analysis with Pandas and Machine learning with tensor flow. I started to love repairing and fixing up things on my own. It gave me a boost each time I developed a program, or fixed up any error of my device, all this gave me the right motivation to carry on with my day. It was clear to me since then that computer science is my passion.","bhaskar.jpg"
